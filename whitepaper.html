             <h2>5. Security & Compliance</h2>
             <p>Jurisdiction and Legal Compliance

               The German Shepherd Coin (SHEP) project is organized under the jurisdiction of the Cayman Islands, a leading jurisdiction for digital asset initiatives.

               A formal legal review is in progress to assess compliance with applicable Cayman Islands legislation, including but not limited to securities laws, anti-money laundering (AML) frameworks, and token issuance standards.

               Based on preliminary legal advice, SHEP is designed as a utility token, intended to grant access to platform features and community benefits, and is not classified as a security under Cayman Islands law.

               The SHEP project team is committed to ongoing regulatory monitoring and will seek additional legal opinions for other jurisdictions, where necessary, to ensure full compliance for the marketing and distribution of SHEP tokens globally.</p> 
            

             <h2></h2>

             <h2>7. Conclusion</h2>
             <p>GSDC is more than a meme coin—it's a utility-backed ecosystem blending crypto innovation with a cause</p> 
             <p>that resonates: the love of German Shepherds and the support of pets everywhere. With a strong</p> 
             <p>community, useful tools, and a charitable core, GSDC is barking up the right blockchain.</p>
